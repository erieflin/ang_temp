When a patient enters our inpatient drug rehab program, our staff takes a hands on approach to determine the most effective form of therapy. This involves more than just helping a patient cleanse the drugs from their system and dealing with withdrawal systems. It requires a full assessment to uncover the root cause of the addiction and then developing a therapy plan that deals with the physical, mental, and social aspects of the current condition.  If one therapy option shows little success, we can identify the reasons for failure and switch to another therapy option. Furthermore, because we use multiple types of therapy, we can easily incorporate support groups that might be more effective when dealing with struggling patients.

While there are many different ways to treat a drug or alcohol addiction, the most comprehensive and long-lasting approach is to seek out a quality inpatient drug rehab facility. While some people may be able to quit drugs or alcohol cold turkey, this can be an extremely difficult process and is often dangerous for individuals who may be suffering from withdrawals from alcohol or certain painkiller and anxiety medications.  Quitting cold turkey also doesnt address the underlying problems at the root of many drug and alcohol addictions, which is why it is can be so difficult to sustain long-term recovery. This is also why many outpatient facilities fail to reach the success rates many inpatient programs enjoy.  While the outpatient option can provide quality medical care and any necessary support, the time of treatment is limited and much less comprehensive that what would be found at an inpatient program.
