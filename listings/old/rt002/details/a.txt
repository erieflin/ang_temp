Rehabilitation at The Hills Treatment Center is nothing ordinary, not a revolving door clinic where one-size-all treatment plans may or may not work.  The Hills provides a myriad of specialized treatment programs that support the addicted person and their loved one from start to finish in the course of rehabilitation.  Treatment plans are made on an individual basis, and the experts at The Hills involve the addicted person throughout, knowing that they must have a stake in their own recovery and rehabilitation. The team of clinicians, paraprofessionals, patient and loved ones all work toward the same goals together.  You are never alone in rehab at The Hills Treatment Center. Do you consider your pet part of your family, an integral part of your support system? If you do then we encourage you to bring your pet to The Hills Treatment Center and have them be a part of your treatment experience.  

The staff at The Hills Treatment Center has always believed that clients participate more enthusiastically when they know that their pets are well taken care of by the pet owners themselves. Neurologically speaking taking care of a pet and experiencing unconditional love can raise dopamine and serotonin levels. In early recovery raising dopamine and serotonin levels in healthy ways can be crucial to starting long term recovery. This is why we invite your pets to join you throughout your journey of recovery.
