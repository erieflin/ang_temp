Our focus is entirely within the scope of men ages 25 and up, and who are at least relatively mature in how they live and conduct themselves.  This means that we tend to attract male clients who are either working, going to college, attending outpatient treatment or something of a mix.  These are guys who, notwithstanding to their recent struggles with addiction or alcoholism, are responsible enough in their new sobriety to wake up each morning and partake in life as a productive member of society

Herbert House is not an effective sober living environment for those who struggle with extreme dual-diagnosis issues or are otherwise in need of constant oversight and monitoring.  And while we do offer 24/7 onsite staff presence, the purpose for this lies more in offering guidance, nominal structure and ongoing support for those of whom are dealing with outside life issues inherent to those who would otherwise be living on their own.  One of many common examples might be, a resident who maybe just scored poorly on a college exam today and is struggling with cravings to drink or use as a means of calming the emotional pain.  The irony here is that, while it’s an unfortunate event for him, the growing experience of walking through this pain and emerging on the other side can be a monumental victory for someone so accustomed to numbing the pain.  We hate to say it, and we hate to see it, but this type of pain is so often a wonderful opportunity for our experienced staff to step in and help them in carving out new patterns for living life as a mature, sober adult.
